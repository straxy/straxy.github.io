Hi! I am Strahinja, the author of the Embedded Journey.

I taught different Embedded Systems and Embedded Linux courses (among others) at University of Belgrade - School of Electrical Engineering.

I have also been working with Embedded software since 2011, working on all kinds of Embedded software development (baremetal, RTOS, Linux) in C/C++ and often Python.

Recently, I have started contributing to the [QEMU project](https://www.qemu.org), since I used it a lot both in teaching and development.
